                  I am a Fourth Year Computer Engineering student at RIT. I am
                  interested in Hardware Design and Low-Level embedded
                  development. I am proficient in a number of languages
                  including: VHDL, C, Assembly (ARM and MIPS), Python and
                  learning Rust.
                  <br>

                        <p>haC64 is a Commodore 64 Emulator designed in VHDL
                        on an FPGA (Xilinx Basys3). This was a hackathon
                        project that I worked with a partner on, it is still
                        under development. Once we have the 6502 (The
                        processor for the Commodore) finished, we plan on
                        workin on the VIC (The Video Controller) and using the
                        Basys3's VGA port for video output.</p>

                        for the Xilinx Basys3 Development board. The procesor
                        was designed in stages over the semester, and then
                        combined later, when timing analysis was performed to
                        find the highest clock frequency at which the
                        processor could function. This was a project for

                        Software Engineering technician at D3 Engineering, where
                        I primarily worked with Embedded Linux and C development
                        on Texas Instruments' TDA line of processors, for
                        automotive vision applications. I also led the design
                        and execution of the testing framework for the latest
                        line of products (TDA4 Board). While working with these
                        processors, I gained experience working with I2C, Linux
                        Device Tree modification, and other skills.

                            means that I am a staff member in a class, and I

                            students practical applications of the information
                            they learn in Lecture. I help teach students how to
                            debug, and write good code/good practices with
                            hardware. I also grade students work, and help

                        basic Cyber Security and encryption algorithms. My
                        second summer at iD Tech, I was a Lead Instructor, and
                        with this promotion, I was one of the management staff
                        to whom the other staff members could look up to. I was
                        in charge of mentoring staff members who were new,
                        mentoring students if they had troubles, and
                        administering Medications to students. </p>
